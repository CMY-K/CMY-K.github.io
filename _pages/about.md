I am a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Technology and Science at Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen (HITSZ), under the guidance of [Associate Professor Cuiyun Gao](https://cuiyungao.github.io). My academic focus lies in code-based large language models, and I am preparing to apply for Ph.D. programs in Hong Kong starting Fall 2026 to further explore this field.
